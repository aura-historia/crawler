# Pair of Finished New York Industrial Machine Cast Bench Legs
$175
These cast iron bench legs were originally made to match benches with industrial style tables, however, they have such a great look that they will work well on any bench. The top plate has four mounting holes in each leg ready to go. You can make your own bench top or ask about our range of bench tops available. We blacken and lacquer them during our finishing process to create a barrier against rust. The finishing requires 1-2 weeks of processing. Available as shown and sold as a pair. 
If you need them unfinished please see item number [M201402R](https://ogtstore.com/industrial-machine-table-legs/pair-of-raw-new-york-industrial-machine-cast-bench-legs/).
